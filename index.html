    <h1>The Dark Web</h1>
    
    <p> The <strong>dark web</strong> is the World Wide Web content that exists on darknets, overlay networks that use the Internet but require specific software, configurations or authorization to access.[1][2] The dark web forms a small part of the deep web, the part of the Web not indexed by web search engines, although sometimes the term deep web is mistakenly used to refer specifically to the dark web.<br>
        The darknets which constitute the dark web include small, friend-to-friend peer-to-peer networks, as well as large, popular networks like<em> Tor, Freenet, I2P and Riffle</em> operated by public organizations and individuals. Users of the dark web refer to the regular web as Clearnet due to its unencrypted nature.[8] The Tor dark web may be referred to as onionland,[9] a reference to the network's top-level domain suffix .onion and the traffic anonymization technique of onion routing.</p>
